# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using PyTorch

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for classifying chest X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19. It was developed as part of a guided hands-on course using PyTorch and ResNet-18, with a focus on medical imaging and deep learning.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Custom Dataset and DataLoader**: Created using PyTorch to manage image data effectively.
- **Data Transformations**: Applied standard preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tuned a pre-trained ResNet-18 model on a real-world chest X-ray dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Visualized predictions, tracked training and validation performance, and used accuracy as a metric.
